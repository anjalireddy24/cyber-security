 How Malicious Browser Extensions Harm Users

1.  Data Theft
- Extensions can access sensitive data like login credentials, financial info, and personal files.
- In corporate settings, this includes intellectual property and client data.

2.  Credential Harvesting
- Some extensions capture usernames and passwords as users type them into websites.
- These credentials can be used for unauthorized access to systems, emails, or cloud services.

3.  Keylogging & Corporate Espionage
- Extensions with keylogging capabilities can record every keystroke.
- This includes emails, chat messages, and internal documents—valuable for industrial espionage.

4.  Malware Deployment
- Malicious extensions can act as delivery vehicles for ransomware, spyware, or remote access trojans (RATs).
- Once installed, they can compromise entire IT infrastructures.

5.  Data Manipulation
- They can alter webpage content—like modifying financial reports or interfering with online transactions.

6.  Network Exploitation
- Some extensions exploit network vulnerabilities to spread malware across systems.
- They may create backdoors or escalate privileges within an organization.

7.  User Tracking & Profiling
- Extensions can monitor browsing habits, search history, and online behavior.
- This data is used for targeted phishing or building detailed user profiles.

8.  Hijacking Legitimate Extensions
- Attackers may hijack or buy legitimate extensions and push malicious updates to users.
- These updates can silently activate harmful features.

9.  Sideloading Risks
- Extensions installed from unofficial sources (sideloaded) bypass security checks.
- These are more likely to be spoofed or bundled with malware.
