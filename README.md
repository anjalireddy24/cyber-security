I Analyze suspicious links or attachments
Sender address is security@paypa1.com instead of the official paypal.com.
Link text looks like PayPal: https://paypal.com.secure-login-verify.com
Real domain is secure-login-verify.com, which is not owned by PayPal — an example of subdomain spoofing.
Look for urgent or threatening language in the email body
We have temporarily limited your access” — creates fear of account loss
Verify your information immediately” — demands instant action
Failure to do so within 24 hours will result in permanent account closure” — strong threat to force compliance
🔗Note any mismatched URLs
Displayed link: https://paypal.com.secure-login-verify.com
Real domain: secure-login-verify.com
❓ Why suspicious:
The real PayPal domain is paypal.com
In this link, “paypal.com” is just part of a subdomain (paypal.com.secure-login-verify.com) owned by the attacker
Everything before the last two dots in a domain can be faked — the real ownership is determined by the last two segments (secure-login-verify.com)
✅ Learning Outcome
I am able to detect some of phishing emails.
Understand the phishing email headers.
